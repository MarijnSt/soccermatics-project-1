# Soccermatics Pro Project 1

- Think of a player who interests you.
- What actions did they perform that were important and why?
- Plot the actions and describe how the data supports or contradicts your own analysis.
- Collect statistics on that player for the tournament and put them in context by comparing them to other players (you can use a statistical test here, if appropriate)
- Write a short text (readable by a coach) using at most two figures that illustrate your point.
